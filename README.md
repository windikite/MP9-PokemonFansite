My 9th mini-project! This was a particularly fun one, but as there were many bonuses it was important to pick the right battles to keep on schedule. Here is what this site has:

1. A home page with a welcoming message and links to what the site provides.  
2. A pokedex page where you can search up any pokemon and be linked to a details page for that pokemon. You can search by name with partial matches or by pokedex number.  
3. A hidden details page meant to only be accessible by the prior links, that displays specific information from that pokemon. The pokemon to display is first saved to local storage when clicking on the link to reach here. Then it is used in the api call and the page is populated afterwards.  
4. (Bonus): A page showing various moves available within the games. They are called on page load, packaged into table rows, and appended to the table.  
5. (Bonus): A page showing various abilities available within the games. These are handled exactly as the moves are in their generation.    

As an additional note, the header with navbar and footer are dynamically added via javascript. I am looking forward to react components to simplify this and provide other features, but this was worthwhile for the moment.  

This site should be easily used by opening the index.html file and utilizing the navbar to navigate from there. Bootstrap is bundled along with the program, and there are no other requirements.
